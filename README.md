# Data-Visualisation-Empowering-Business-with-Effective-Insights

An online retail store needs help analyzing data to identify major revenue contributors and plan for next year. <br>
They want insights on both operations and marketing, including demographic analysis, to find high-performing areas. <br>
I'm tasked, in this virtual internship by [Tata](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-experience/MyXvBcppsW2FkNYCX/tata-group/data-visualisation-p5xo/framing-the-business-scenario), with preparing analytics and insights for a meeting to guide their expansion decisions.

## Project Description
This job simulation had four task.
<details><summary>Task 1: Framing the Business Scenario</summary> <br>
I created a set of questions that I anticipated each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to.

<details><summary>Task 2: Choosing the Right Visuals</summary> <br>
In this task, I was required to choose the right charts based upon need such as Comparison, Distribution, Relationship, and Composition.

<details><summary>Task 3: Creating Effective Visuals</summary> <br>

In this task, I created [visuals](Tata) around four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested.

**Data cleanup** <br>
The following steps were taken to clean the [data](OnlineRetailDataSet), using data transformation methods to get rid of the bad data:<br>
• Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit <br>
• Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0 <br>

**Questions from the CEO and CMO** <br>
Question 1<br>
The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

Question 2<br>
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

Question 3<br>
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

Question 4<br>
The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.
